# space_invader

Download and extract ".idea.rar" and ".venv.rar" :bulb:

Open, execute "main.py" and you can play space invader :high_brightness:

Move your spaceship with either arrow keys or w,a,s,d keys :ok_hand:

Shoot as many ufos as you can :thumbsup:

The game is over when at least one ufo collides with the space ship or reaches the window's bottom :collision:

Hope you enjoy my game :green_heart:
